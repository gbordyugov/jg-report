\subsection{Telecom conferences}
During the three years of the project, we maintained (mostly)
bi-weekly Skype conferences to synchronize our activities between
Tokyo and Berlin. The calls mainly included Christoph Schmal, Jihwan
Myung and GB.

\subsection{Visits between Japan and Germany}
The following visits between Tokyo and Berlin took place:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] Pia Rose visited Riken from Marth 2nd through April 25th 2015,
  \item[-] Christoph Schmal visited Riken from June 18th through July 3rd
  2014,
  \item[-] Hanpspeter Herzel visited Riken from July 17th through July

  2014 through 2016,
  \item[-] GB visited Riken from February 10th through March 1st 2014.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conferences}
The results of the research on the project were presented at the
Gordon Conference on Chronobiology (Newport, RI in summer 2013, also
first contact with Jihwan Myung established there), at the conference
of the Japanese Society for Mathematical Biology (Osaka, Summer 2014),
and at the meeting of SRBR (summer 2016).
