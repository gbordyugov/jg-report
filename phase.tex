\subsection{Circadian entrainment phase: Towards a unified mathematical
model}

The coordination of the oscillation periods between the behaviour and
the environment is not the only phenomenon in chronobiology. Those
periods can be perfectly aligned, but the relative phase of this
alignment, or the entrainment phase, is a no less important feature of
circadian entrainment and has been focus of research for many decades,
see, for instance,~\cite{pittendrigh1981circadian}.
